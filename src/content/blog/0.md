## Welcome to Good First Issue: Unveiling Open-Source Stories!

Have you ever wondered how to start contributing to an open-source project? Have you ever felt the desire to fix a bug in a project but found yourself unsure where to begin? 
We've been there too! 
That's why we created "Good First Issue," a video podcast that explores the world of open-source through conversations with maintainers and contributors.

## Meet Our Team: Antonio, Federico, and Luca

Like any good idea worth its salt, Good First Issue started as a casual chat among friends and soon turned into a .dev domain. 
Our goal is to release a new episode every month, initially live-streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/goodfirstissue) and later available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZX3A5JbM6LWvWScT1ZMygQ). 
Don't miss out! Subscribe to our channels on Twitch and YouTube to receive notifications about our latest episodes.

## Calling All Open-Source Enthusiasts!

Are you passionate about open-source? So are we! We're always on the lookout for new guests. If you're a maintainer or contributor eager to share your story, [send us an email](mailto:goodfirstissue@gmail.com)
